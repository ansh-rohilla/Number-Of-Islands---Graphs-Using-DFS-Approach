# Number-Of-Islands---Graphs-Using-DFS-Approach
ChatGPT said:  This C++ solution solves the Number of Islands problem using DFS. Whenever an unvisited land cell ('1') is found, DFS marks all connected land cells as visited, counting them as one island. The algorithm iterates through the grid and returns the total number of distinct islands.
